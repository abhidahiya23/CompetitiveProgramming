Uncertain Steps

Problem Description
Codu is trying to go down stairs from his building to ground floor.

He can go 3 ways:

1. Walk 1 step at a time.

2. Extend his legs and go 2 steps at a time.

3. Jump down 3 steps at a time.

Given n steps, calculate the number of possible ways to reach the ground floor, provided he can jump 3 steps at most once during this process.

That is, he can jump down 3 steps only once, but at any time, if he wishes, while walking down the stairs.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000000.

Input Format
Single Integer denoting the number of Steps, N.

Output
Number of ways to reach ground floor.

As the number can be huge, give output modulo 1000000007.
